pac
===

Pac is an Arch Linux script that interfaces with the pacman package manager. I wrote the pac script so that I would not have to type all the pacman commands. The script is used for efficiency, it allows the user to perform day-to-day package maintenance on the system.

Installation

1. Download the pac repository. 
2. Unzip pac-master.zip.
